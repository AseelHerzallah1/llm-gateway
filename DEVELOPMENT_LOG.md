## Phase 0 — GitHub repo init

### Task 0.1 — Initialize repository scaffold

**Date:** 2026-07-10  
**Commit:** `b28f655` — `phase-0/task-0.1: initialize repository scaffold`

**What we built:**
- `.gitignore` (Python, `.env`, venv, IDE files)
- Minimal `README.md`
- `docs/` directory placeholder

**Decisions:**
- Public repo for portfolio visibility
- Repo name: `llm-gateway`
- Commit convention: `phase-N/task-M: description`
- README kept minimal until Phase 8

**Tests:** `git status` clean; `git log -1` shows single author `AseelHerzallah1`

**Problems:**
- Cursor auto-added `Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>` to first commit
- Fixed by amending commit message and force-pushing
- Added local `prepare-commit-msg` hook + `.cursor/rules/no-cursor-attribution.mdc`
- User disabled Commit Attribution in Cursor Settings

**Lessons:**
- Always verify `git show -s --format=%B HEAD` after agent-created commits
- `.git/hooks/` is local only — not pushed to GitHub

## Phase 1 — Scope and API contract

### Task 1.1 — Define v1 scope and boundaries

**Date:** 2026-07-10  
**Commit:** _(pending push)_

**What we built:**
- `docs/SCOPE.md` — problem statement, v1 in/out-of-scope, success criteria, phase map

**Decisions:**
- Strict 9-phase order; no skipping ahead
- Semantic cache in Phase 6 (after observability in Phase 5)
- PII tokenization deferred to Phase 9 (v2)
- LangChain excluded from core unless explicitly decided later
- Explanations to developer in English; brief Arabic summaries per phase only

**Tests:** Documentation only — no runtime tests

**Alternatives considered:**
- Observability before cache vs cache before observability → chose observability first (user's required order) so we can measure cache impact when it lands in Phase 6

**Meeting-ready summary:**
> Before writing code, I defined strict v1 scope for an LLM gateway focused on three deep pillars: streaming proxy, semantic cache, and percentile observability. I explicitly cut PII handling, multi-provider routing, LangChain, and regex security to later phases so engineering depth stays on systems problems, not admin CRUD.
